              Welcome to the website of the Chi Zeta chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity!
            </p>
            <p>
              We are proud to be part of the history of Alpha Kappa Psi, both here at NJIT and around the world.
              Alpha Kappa Psi is a co-ed professional fraternity dedicated to developing principled business leaders.
              We emphasize five core values: brotherhood, knowledge, integrity, service, and unity.
              These values make up everything that we do as an organization and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making the decision to become involved in Alpha Kappa Psi has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my college career thus far.
              As an active founding member, I learned the inner workings of establishing an organization from the ground up.
              This fraternity has shown me what it is like to be a part of something so much bigger than myself, while also helping me realize how much I can contribute as an individual.
              Not only have I made lifelong friendships and indelible memories, but I am confident that I am better prepared for life after college.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am incredibly proud of our chapter for accomplishing so many milestones this past year.
              Moreover, I am honored to be the president of an organization of such inspiring, loyal, and dedicated individuals.
              I am grateful to call these people my Brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
              On behalf of this brotherhood here at Chi Zeta, I invite you to look through our site and learn about all the benefits our organization has to offer.
              Please do not hesitate to reach out to us, and we hope you will continue to learn more and join us at a future rush event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sincerely,
              </br></br>

              In the summer of 2016, Awais Qazi, an involved senior in the Martin Tuchman School of Management (MTSoM), wanted to make a significant impact on campus. He realized that in order to get the most out of his education, he needed to add value to NJIT's business degree. This was the impetus to begin the journey to establish an NJIT chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi), the oldest and largest professional business fraternity. Founded at New York University, Alpha Kappa Psi is a unique, prestigious association of students, professors, graduates and professionals with common interests and goals who join this fraternity to take advantage of valuable educational and networking opportunities.

              <div class="col-md-5">
                <h1>Smile if you love AKPsi</h1>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              The MTSoM has been trying to make the school a better place for its students, and it has been doing so without the input of the students for years. The best way for students to get involved is by joining this fraternity, which is a tremendous step in making NJIT’s business degree more valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NJIT colony had its first colonization ceremony on September 21, 2016, when about thirty students became the original colonists of AKPsi at NJIT with the help of Kortney Petry, NJITs Chapter Educational Resource Coordinator. AKPsi gained momentum on campus when these colonists brought in new members with each meeting, adding new membership each week. In the weeks following the colonization, the colony elected an E-Board that works together to organize events and programs. In addition, the Spring 2017 semester will consist of the process to become an official chapter, which entails the pledge process, application requirements, and chartering ceremony in April.

            <p>
              This fraternity’s vision is to have a union of ambitious students working hard to get NJIT on the national spotlight. These students hope that NJIT’s chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi will become competitive with chapters of bigger schools such as Rutgers, Stern, and Wharton. This is completely feasible, yet only possible if the students are actively involved.Instead of being a small management school within a tech school, AKPsi will allow the School of Management and NJIT to be complimentary, appealing to the Management School’s slogan “Business with the Power of STEM.” This interdisciplinary business-technology environment is what makes NJIT-AKPsi truly unique, and students should focus on that distinctive element to stand out, both at this school and at the national level.
            </p>
            <p>
              NJIT's colony of AKPsi has become recognized and well-known on campus, with its membership at an astounding 66 students. Today, its members are seen as a distinguished group of strong leaders on campus. By encouraging all majors to rush this elite and selective organization, AKPsi will prepare students not only to be competitive in today's business world but also to excel and be leaders in the future. As a professional fraternity, it will create a valuable, large network for its members while maintaining the social aspects of Greek life. By establishing a comfortable brotherhood of respectable individuals, Alpha Kappa Psi will create a new legacy at this school, leaving an indelible mark on the NJIT community.
